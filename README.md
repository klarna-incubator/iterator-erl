## First steps

<details>
 <summary>Installation (for Admins)</summary>
  
  Currently, new repositories can be created only by a Klarna Open Source community lead. Please reach out to us if you need assistance.
  
  1. Create a new repository by clicking ‘Use this template’ button.
  
  2. Make sure your newly created repository is private.
  
  3. Enable Dependabot alerts in your candidate repo settings under Security & analysis. You need to enable ‘Allow GitHub to perform read-only analysis of this repository’ first.
</details>

1. Update `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`.

2. Optionally, clone [the default contributing guide](https://github.com/klarna-incubator/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) into `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`.

3. Do *not* edit `LICENSE`.
